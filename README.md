# Avocado Market Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of rising vegetarianism on avocado prices over time and how these price changes affect the total and specific sales volumes for different varieties of Hass avocados. By utilizing data visualization and statistical analysis, the project provides insights into consumer preferences and regional consumption patterns. The analysis helps to quantify and compare the influence of price changes on avocado sales across various regions and sizes, offering a comprehensive view of the avocado market.

## Objective
The project aims to answer four key questions:

1. How does the price of avocados influence their sales volume?
2. Which regions consumed the most avocados from 2015 to 2021?
3. Given that PLU4770 represents the largest Hass avocados, is it also the most consumed variety?
4. Does the trend in avocado consumption in the top-consuming city reflect the overall trend in the U.S.?

By addressing these questions, the project aims to provide insights into how vegetarianism influences avocado prices and consumption patterns across different regions and size categories.

## Tools
The analysis was conducted using MySQL and the R Programming Language. MySQL was employed for data storage, cleaning, and initial preprocessing, facilitating the organization and management of the large dataset. It allowed for efficient querying and handling of data, ensuring that the information was prepared accurately for further analysis. R was utilized for data analysis and visualization. With its powerful statistical and graphical capabilities, R enabled the exploration of the dataset, identification of trends, and creation of comprehensive visual representations of the findings, making the insights easily interpretable.
